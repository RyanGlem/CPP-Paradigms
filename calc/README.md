Simple calculator that can multiply, divide, subtract, add , root, and compute exponentials

Converts an infix arithemtic expression into a computer-friendly postfix expression to compute from left to right

## Postfix can't compute float numbers from user input. So 1.1111.... can't be calculated

### Usage

Clone down the repository

Cd into the local folder the repository is in

Run *make lab2* in the command line

The executable can be run in cd calc/src by writing ./main in the command line

Enter in any form of valid equations -> (6 * 6) + 67 ^ 3

If the equation is invalid it will continue to ask for a valid equation until the flag (n) is hit

There is an *input.txt.* and *output.txt* file for various test cases
