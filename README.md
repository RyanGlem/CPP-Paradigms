Simple calculator that can multiply, divide, subtract, add and compute exponentials

Converts an infix arithemtic expression into a computer-friendly postfix expression to compute from left to right

## Postfix can't compute float numbers from user input. So 1.1111.... can't be calculated

### Usage
cd into the calc/src folder
run *make lab2* in the command line
Enter in any form of valid equations -> (6 * 6) + 67 ^ 3
